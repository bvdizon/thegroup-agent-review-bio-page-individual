      <span style="color: orange">★★★★★ </span><br />My wife and I recently
      purchased our first home and we had the pleasure of using this agency to
      help us through the process. More specifically, Chris Duffy was absolutely
      incredible in going through each step with us that eventually led to us
      finding and buying our dream home! There was certainly a lot to learn, but
      with the professional and kind heart of Chris, it was a truly exciting
      experience. He made it stress free, fun and guided us through each and
      every step. If you're looking for a great Realtor, my wife and I both
      would highly recommend Chris!!

      <span style="color: orange">★★★★★ </span><br />This was my first time
      buying a home and Chris was phenomenal. He showed us a lot of homes,
      accommodated to my schedule and was super prompt to answer all my
      questions. I trusted him throughout the entire process. He found the
      property that suited all my needs and also helped me negotiate a great
      price. Very positive experience, extremely recommended
